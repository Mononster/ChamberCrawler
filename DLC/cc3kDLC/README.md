ChamberCrawler 3000 -> DLC vision
(multiple interesting features are introduced in this vision).

Created by Marvin Zhan.
This is my first RPG(roguelike) game coding by 
C++ in life. 

The goal of this game is to reach the stair in the
fifth floor. Your score is your final amount of gold
that you have collected.

Use key_up key_down key_left key_right to control the player to move.
Press ‘j’,’k’,’l’, and ‘;' if you want to move sideways.
Press ‘b’ to empower you ability if you are near by a merchant (denoted by M)
Press ‘i’ to open your inventory which could be stored multiple objects.

Install:
Open terminal, and type cd “the destination you stored this game” 
and then type “make”
after approximate 5 seconds of compiling, type ./cc3k the game will start.

Hopefully you will enjoy the game!
